# Godot-Messing
Trying out several functions in GoDot to learn the engine better before my big project.
Trying out adding assets, drawing animations, triggering signals, all that good stuff.
Better to learn all the mistakes I make before I start, rather than getting frustrated in a more complex setting.
Also handy to know some functionality of the engine, so I can include it in the planning, rather than having to re-write the entire project when I learn about it later.
